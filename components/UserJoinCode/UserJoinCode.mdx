# UserJoinCode

The `UserJoinCode` component displays a URL to deparment managers which they can give to their users to join their department. It
also allows them to regenerate the URL in case of security issues and also copy the URL to their clipboard using buttons. (shows loading when
the join code can't be/is being fetched from the backend)

<Props of={UserJoinCode} />

It is normally used in the manage page for the department user type.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <UserJoinCode session={null} host="example.com" />
</Playground>
