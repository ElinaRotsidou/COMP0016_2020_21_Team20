# PlatformsTable

The `PlatformsTable` component displays a table with all the questions on the platfrom. It allows the Admin user type
to change the question body and global default urls and also allows questions to be deleted and added. (if it can't
fetch data from the backend, the table only shows the column names)

<Props of={PlatformsTable} />

It is normally used in the manage page for the Admin user type.

## Basic usage

<Playground>
  <PlatformsTable />
</Playground>
